desc:MIDI CC Only On (CrazyJ36)

/*
Mostly stolen from here: https://github.com/r4dian/Reaper-JSFX/blob/master/MIDI_CC_Toggle_Alternator

Makes all CC input from M-Vave Chocolate (Program Change 3 mode) send 127 (On) each time that midi is received on your midi track.

BEWARE, only use on tracks where your midi channel input is A footswitch that is press for on by default, as your notes and controls will stay on.

Save in the Effects folder on your resource path (there's a "Show REAPER resource path" action if you dunno where it is) 
Then add "MIDI CC  Only On" to the tracks where you need it.
